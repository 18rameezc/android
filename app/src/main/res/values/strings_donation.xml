        \t\tThis hard-coded string, here, is
        just a little part which is apparent
        and understandable of a whole that I
        hope it will be a good companion on
        your journey to earn amazing
        experiences and accomplish great
        difficulties. The tool, open-source
        and free, is always ready to grow
        better and I am just a spectator of
        its 50,000 lines of code. Only thing
        I want to say and leave afterwards is
        that if you value this work and want
        to see it grow, you are always
        welcome to support it.\n

        section,\n\n

        Best regards,\n
        Veli TasalÄ±
